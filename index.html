            <p>
                Subhas Chandra Bose, also known as Netaji, was a prominent Indian nationalist leader who played a key role in India's struggle for independence against British colonial rule. He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha.
                Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism.[i] Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers f                or himself.After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest,Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the party.
